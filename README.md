Kinetic-Viewer
==============

This is some basic viewer software for the upcoming Seagate Kinetic drives. This is based upon the Seagate Kinetic preview library: https://github.com/Seagate/Kinetic-Preview and is written in Python. The viewer provides a GUI for viewing drives contents and interacting with the drive, providing engineers and developers with a simpler visualization of drive contents.


The Kinetic Viewer software requires the host PC to have Python 2.7 installed, and for the Tkinter and Kinetic software libraries to be added.
